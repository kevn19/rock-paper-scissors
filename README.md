# rock-paper-scissors

The Purpose of this project will be to create a simple game of rock paper scissors. This will be initially be played in the console and later we will add a GUI interface.

What I've learned:
1. Create an array and selecting a element from the array
2. Using Math functions such as Math.random() an Math.floor to generate a random number and round them down to an integer respectively.
3. Utilizing the return of one function as the parameter of another. 
4. Using switch statements instead of if and if else statements to write the same code more effeciently.
